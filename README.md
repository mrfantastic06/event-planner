# ðŸ“Œ Project Title: Event Planner
## ðŸ‘¤ Student Name: [Atshaal Fathoni Al Aufa]

### ðŸ“„ Description:
 Event Planner is a command-line based application that allows users to plan and manage events. The application supports basic CRUD operations such as creating, viewing, updating, and deleting events. Users can invite guests, schedule dates, and coordinate event details. Additionally, it includes features like report generation and import/export via CSV for better usability and data management.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives:
1. To implement CRUD functionalities in Java using CLI.

2. To apply file handling for data persistence.

3. To create a modular and user-friendly design.

4. To demonstrate the ability to manage event-related data effectively.

5. To validate inputs to avoid incorrect or incomplete data.

6. To generate useful reports based on user activity.

7. To implement CSV import and export for easier data sharing.

8. To gain hands-on experience with Java Collections and File I/O.

9. To ensure error handling is robust and user-friendly.

10. To build a project that is both practical and extendable in the future.

### Project Requirements List
1. CRUD Operations: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete for events.

2. Command Line Interface: Interactive menu for user-friendly CLI-based operations.

3. Input Validation: Prevents empty fields and ensures correct formats for date and guest inputs.

4. Data Persistence: Saves and loads event data using file handling (serialization and CSV).

5. Modular Design: Uses separate classes (Event, EventManager) for clean and reusable code.

6. Report Generation: Provides summary reports like total events and invited guests.

7. Documentation: Code is documented with explanations in README and structured naming conventions.

8. Test Cases & Outputs: Includes example inputs/outputs for all major features (see below).

9. Error Handling: Detects and handles invalid choices, file errors, and format issues.

10. Import/Export CSV: Allows event data to be exported/imported from .csv files.
